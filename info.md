#### Version 1.0
This app is aims to visualize LibInsight data in a table and in a network visualization. Feel free play around with the preloaded data before uploading your own.

To explore your network, upload a properly formatted .csv export from LibInsight below. Your data will be rendered in the Table View. To render a network visualization, you will have to select the two columns that represent Librarians and Collaborators (or Faculty). For example, in a visualization of library instruction over a semester, the first column represents Librarians, while the second column represents course collaborators.
